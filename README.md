# Overview
During the direct sales process the perspective buyer will likely have multiple objections 
that they will throw out before they decide to buy something.  A good salesman is able to 
overcome those objections and move the sales process forward towards a close.

This program will throw out a randomly generated objection for the salesman to practice overcoming
and responding to. It also allows them to create their own custom objections to add into the deck.

This is planned to be developed into an android application. This code is the basic functions of the android app.
